- 👋 Hi, I’m @tafararafat
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming and developing, though I have no experience at all, I basically don't know coding at all but I still love it because I actually tried it and it was fun, I am also interested in tweaking and stuff, I also love tips on different operating systems, how to make them run faster etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, in High School, senior and no time at all, literally schedule is full so I hope after High School I might have some time and start learning!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making games? I guess, I mean I will not be of any help because I don't know coding but I think through that I might learn something!
- 📫 How to reach me? I guess email me at mohammedarrh386@gmail.com or isarafat@outlook.com, any works and I check them both very often.
